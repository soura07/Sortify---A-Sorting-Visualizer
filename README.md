# 📊 Sortify — A Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to **Sortify**, a beautifully crafted and interactive sorting algorithm visualizer built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project allows users to observe how various sorting algorithms work behind the scenes through smooth, animated visualizations.

- 📌 Visual representation of:
  - 🫧 **Bubble Sort**
  - 🧮 **Selection Sort**
  - 🧩 **Insertion Sort**
  - ⚡ **Quick Sort**
  - 🧬 **Merge Sort**
- ⚙️ Adjustable speed and array size
- 📱 Responsive design for all devices

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5** — structure
- **CSS3** — styling and animations
- **JavaScript** — sorting logic and interactivity

---

## 💡 How It Works

- The user selects a sorting algorithm.
- The app generates a random array of bars.
- As sorting begins, bars animate to visually demonstrate how the algorithm rearranges the array.
- Speed and size of the array can be changed dynamically.
